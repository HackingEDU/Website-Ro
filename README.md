## Installation
Run `npm install` in the directory, then `npm update`.

## Running Express
Run `npm start`. The Express server defaults to port 80, and you may have an EACCES error when trying to run it. You can change the port number in `server.js` to anything above 1023; we recommend port 8080.

## Viewing Website
Browse to http://localhost or http://localhost:8080, depending on your port number.
